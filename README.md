# AdventOfCode2017
A group repository for the 2017 AdventOfCode (http://adventofcode.com/2017).

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
